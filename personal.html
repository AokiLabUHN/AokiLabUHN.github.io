        I am a clinician scientist at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. Throughout my clinical career as a hematologist, I have treated numerous patients with lymphoid cancers and have witnessed many suffer from progressive or refractory disease. These experiences ignited a strong desire to pursue translational research aimed at improving patient survival through the development of more effective therapies.

      <h4 class="subtitle">Research</h4>
      </p>
      The central focus of my research is to understand how interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment regulate cancer development and shape the tumor-educated microenvironment in lymphoid cancers, ultimately leading to biomarker discovery and novel therapeutic targets. I employ cutting-edge technologies, including single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics assays, in conjunction with state-of-the-art preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. By integrating these approaches, my goal is to enhance patient outcomes through the establishment of precision medicine. To achieve this, I actively collaborate with leading researchers and clinicians worldwide, including clinical trial groups
